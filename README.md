# Vehicle Network Security Lab (CAN Bus Analysis)

This project analyzes in-vehicle CAN bus traffic to identify anomalous behavior and propose defensive mitigation strategies.
It focuses on **monitoring, detection, and hardening**, not real-world exploitation.

## Features
- CAN log ingestion (CSV)
- Baseline profiling (IDs, frequency, timing)
- Anomaly detection
- Defensive rules simulation
- Report generation

## Tech Stack
Python, pandas, numpy

## Disclaimer
This project uses synthetic lab data and is intended for educational and defensive research purposes only.
